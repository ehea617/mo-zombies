# Mo' Zombies!
The Mo' Zombies mod is a mod for Minecraft 1.7.10. It adds 14 new mobs to the game. Due to having less time to work on the mod than I used to have, I am releasing the source code of the mod under the GPL V3 license. I have cleaned up the source code to the best of my ability by removing unused assets and unused snippets of code along with removing the update checking code. This may be the last update I put out for the mod unless someone else is willing to continue development.

### Old versions
All old versions of the mod will now be available here: https://mega.nz/#F!UUZg3Yra!ymf3N81VIBCwHpJvjlpWvw

### Technical notes
* None of the code is commented and I do not have the time to go through and do so myself.
* Things that were removed include outdated translation files, the update notifier, unused achievement code, and unused textures for a zombie alchemist
* Version 2.1.1 of Mo' Zombies was built using Java JDK 8 Update 31 and [Minecraft Forge 10.13.4.1448 for Minecraft 1.7.10](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html)
